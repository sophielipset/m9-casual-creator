# Symmetric Spiral Doodler

### Setup 

This code should be run with Processing. I have been using the Processing IDE.

### Information

This project gives users the opportunity to create doodles, playing with symmetries and colors. Users can increase how many circles are drawn at a time and change the color scheme using key commands. Additionally, colors change based on the mouse's position from the origin, so users can play around with where they start their designs from. Once the user is satisfied with their design, they can use another key command (ENTER), to save their design. Commands are given to help users understand the application that they are working with. 

I chose to explore symmetries because it is something that I've studied a lot in my math classes. I originally thought about creating a kaleidoscope application because I've been studying the geometry behind three-dimensional kaleidoscopes, but I wanted to give users more flexibility with where the designs can overlap each other. Instead, I translate cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates to rotate around an origin for a set angle measurement (depending on how many symmetry divisions the user desires) before translating back to cartesian coordinates. Although I did not build a kaleidoscope application, I loved working with symmetries and coordinate systems, which are concepts I've worked with a lot in my geometry and algebra courses. This system is meaningful to me because it is a nice intersection of my interests in mathematics, computer science, and visual arts. 

The mathematical translation was far more difficult than I anticipated because I started this project entirely unfamiliar with Processing. The documentation was sparser than I would have liked, but I spent a lot of time mapping out the math, then understanding the functions available to me. I also struggled finding a way to vary the color while still making the system visually pleasing. If I were to build another system similar to this, I would love to try building an HTML/CSS/JS program instead to see how those commands differ now that I am more familiar with Processing. 

There are no bugs that I am aware of, but, to save a design as an image (PNG file), the file must be saved to the user's computer.
